### Previous Version History

### Changes in v2.4 - build 2.4.5472.4071 - 25 December 2014
* Bugfix release for a CPU/Framerate issue in v2.3, otherwise no changes from v2.3

### Changes in v2.3 - build 2.3.5471.37348 - 24 December 2014
* Revised vertical/horizontal snap
 * Now works with rotated/skewed parts - centers the part along the parent part axis.
 * Vertical snap will center itself lengthwise for horizontal parts in the SPH
 * Snapping disabled while a gizmo is active
* Bugfixes
 * Part movements made with snaps now work with undo/redo in the editor
 * Fixed an issue where snapping, using a gizmo, and pressing space to reset the gizmo warped the part away by 2x its original position.

### v2.2 - 2.2.5470.2764 - 23 December 2014

Bugfix: v2.1 caused a GUI error when opening the vessel loading screen. This was caused by a conflict between this mod's GUI skin and KSP's GUI skin.
This mod has been reverted to use the generic GUI skin to work around this issue. Otherwise no functional changes vs. v2.1

### v2.1 - build 2.1.5469.41325 - 22 December 2014
* Added new vertical snap (V)
 1. Place parts like normal.
 2. Once part is placed, hover over the part with your mouse and hit V. Part will align itself vertically to the middle of its parent part.
* Added new horizontal snap (H)
 1. Place parts like normal.
 2. Once part is placed, hover over the part with your mouse and hit H. Part will align itself horizontally to the middle of its parent part.
* Changed attachment mode toggling (T): now only toggles surface attachment of selected part.
* Added toolbar icon ("EEX") to bring up settings menu
 * Customize hotkeys
 * Customize angle snap values
 * Customize symmetry level
* Added KSP-AVC versioning support

### v2.0 - build 2.0.5466.37911 - 19 December 2014
* KSP 0.90 support
* Changed attachment mode toggling:
 * Changed Hotkey to "T", previous hotkey conflicted with new stock symmetry mode toggle (R)
 * Now toggles between surface attachment and node attachment. When surface attachment is enabled, part will not attach to regular nodes (green dots).
* Veritcal snap removed, new 0.90 editor does not have the same functionality. Currently working on new method of providing automatic vertical snap without having to use the translation gizmo.
* Removed launchpad/runway toggle due to incompatibility with KSP 0.90
* Removed redundant symmetry mode (radial/mirror) toggle, now in stock editor with R hotkey.
* This version is not compatible with any KSP versions prior to 0.90, for 0.25 use v1.4 which can be downloaded at the github page under releases.
